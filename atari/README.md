# Atari XE mini
Wireless universal 40% keyboard in a 12x4U format, including mounting holes for BM40 cases and gaskets.
Will be using ZMK on a nice!nano

## WARNING
This project is a personal project, i just built one prototype. It's not considered complete, nor tested or error-free.

I won't develop this much, just releasing it as-is for anybody knowledgable picking up and maybe building upon it.

It is NOT ready to take the files and produce a working keyboard!
